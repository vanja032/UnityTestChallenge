<h4>Setup:</h4>

- [Install Unity 2020.3.15f2](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)
- [Fork Repository to your GitHub](https://github.com/Nordeus/jobfair21-frontend-challange)
- **Import Project** to Unity and make sure to select **PC platform (Win/Mac)** before opening 

<h4>Game Description:</h4>

We are working on a [platformer game](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/platformer-microgame-151055). Game Mechanics are implemented and working for the PC platform. For controls, we are using standard keys: wasd/arrows + space. You can try out the gameplay by opening MainScene, going into play mode, and hitting the play button.

The player can collect tokens by going through them and killing enemies by jumping on them. If the player collides with the enemy it will be game over. The same thing goes for a player falling from the platform. In order to win player needs to reach the end of the level without dying. 

<h4>Tech Description:</h4> 

The project consists of two scenes: **MainScene** (from which we start the game) and **LevelScene** (which is used for gameplay).

On the MainScene you will find **Main Menu Canvas** with the attached script: **MainMenuCanvas.cs** which you should use for implementing entering a username, high score, and starting the game.

On the LevelScene you will find **Level UI Canvas** with the attached script: **LevelCanvas.cs** which you should use for adding in-game UI, Lose, Win and Pause menu. 

**GameDatabase.cs** holds information regarding **CurrentUser** which you can use for displaying username, a number of collected tokens, killed enemies, or end score.

Gameplay is realized through scheduling events that are executed on Tick in Simulation. Feel free to explore this on your own. Relevant Classes: **Simulation.Event<T>, Simulation**, etc. 

All resources needed for the UI can be found in the folder: **Assets/Resources**
